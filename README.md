# User-Login-Activity-Analyzer-Using-Python
This Python project defines a function, analyze_logins(), that evaluates user login activity by comparing the number of logins on a given day to the user's average daily logins. 

The function calculates a login ratio and displays messages about the user's activity. Additionally,a conditional alert triggers if the login activity exceeds a specified threshold, helping identify unusually high login behavior, which could indicate suspicious activity.

The project demonstrates the use of functions, parameters, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in Python, while providing practical insight into monitoring user behavior.
